* Clojure features to expose
** It's a lisp
  - Data <-> code
  - Prefix notation
  - everithing behave like a function 
  - no distictions between functions and ops (reduce +) or custom apply
  - macros (find a good example here (threading macro maybe))

** Clojure
   - Compiles to JVM, .NET, JS
   - Immutability (PDS)
   - Data literals
   - Functional language (mostly)
     - Create programs by composing functions instead of mutating state
     - Unit testing
   - Concurrency
   - Hosting language integration (examples)

** Tooling
   - Cider
   - Intellij
   - Eclipse
   - Lighttable

** Others
   - Core async
   - Logic prog
   - Typed

** REPL

** Polymorphism

** Lazy seq (collection api is lazy)
